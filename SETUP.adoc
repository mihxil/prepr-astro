= Setup

== Prepr API

Just put the key in `.env`, it can be picked up by astro and the python scripts.

This repo is a for of the astro-demo from prepr. We will just play a bit with it.

== Astro example

- install npm using brew, then follow the steps in `README.md`

It is Running on https://prepr-poc.vpro-test.apps.vpro.cluster.chp4.io/

(deployed via https://git.vpro.nl/vrije-ruimte/michiel/prepr-poc/ (accessible @vpro only))

== Flask example

Also tried a flask frontend, since I'm a bit more familiar with that, and more readily knew how to debug it.

Uses the virtualenvironment described in xref:_data_migration[]

[source, bash]]
